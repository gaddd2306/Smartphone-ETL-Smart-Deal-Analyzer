## 🛠️ Project Architecture & Features

### 1. Data Acquisition (Extraction)
- Built automated web scrapers using `BeautifulSoup` and `Selenium`.
- Harvested live, unstructured market data (pricing, device specifications, item conditions) from various online platforms.

### 2. Data Transformation & Cleaning
- Handled missing values, normalized text formats, and removed duplicates using `Pandas`.
- Performed detailed feature engineering, including extracting storage capacities, categorizing brand tiers, and standardizing item conditions (e.g., Refurbished, Excellent, Good).

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- Implemented and trained a Machine Learning model (`Random Forest Regressor`) to predict the "Fair Market Value" of smartphones based on their specific features.

### 4. Smart Deal Analyzer (Interface)
- Developed an interactive predictor dashboard.
- Users can input or select specific smartphone specifications, and the system instantly evaluates the retail price to flag whether it is a **Good Deal**, **Fair Deal**, or **Overpriced**.
